## Krusty Krab Website

Are you ready, kids? Home of the legendary Krabby Patty, Bikini Bottom’s most famous (and only) fast-food joint. Family-friendly, fry-cook
powered, and managed with just enough pinch of Mr. Krabs’ greed. Dine in, take out, or just loiter while Squidward
glares at you.

## About

A 2-day micro challenge to design and build a website for a fictional business using only HTML and CSS. Developed by a
team of three, the project recreated the world of SpongeBob with a Krusty Krab–themed design, playful visuals, and
on-brand styling. An homage to the animated series that cleverly used Bootstrap to bring Bikini Bottom online in record
time.
